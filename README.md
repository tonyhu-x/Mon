# Mon
Mon is a Monopoly-style board game with some rules and elements reimagined. The game is built with [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ "libGDX Homepage").
## Installation
To install the game, simply download the `JAR` file from the latest [release](https://github.com/tonyhu-x/Mon/releases/).
### Requirements
This game is compiled with JDK 11. Therefore, there is no guarantee that it will run on earlier versions of JRE.
### Running the Game
With the downloaded `JAR`, run the following from the command line:
```
java -jar name_of_binary.jar
```
### Installing from Source Code
Assuming you have Java correctly configured on your system, simply download the source code and run a gradle build with the included gradle wrapper:
```
gradlew run
```
On Windows, use:
```
gradlew.bat run
```

# Game Rules

## Starting a Game
* When a game starts, each player is given $1500.
* Each player starts at the block marked as "Go".
* Each player rolls two dice. The player with the highest sum goes first. The next player is player # (curPlayer + 1). After player four finishes, player one goes.

## Go
* Each time a player passes Go, he/she receives an amount of salary. The amount is $200 at the beginning of each game. It increases by $50 following each pass, capping at $600. Each individual therefore may receive different salaries depending on their pace. 

## Property
* A player can purchase a property if it has not been purchased by another player.
* A player may choose to ungrade a property that he/she owns if he/she stops by the property again. The price of an upgrade is (2^n) times the original purchase price. Note that the player does not have to own every property in the group to upgrade them.
* A player may upgrade any property belonging to the same group he/she is on when it is his/her turn. He/she may not upgrade property out of turn.
* The maximum level that a property can be upgraded to depends on the number of properties the player owns. If the player has a monopoly, each property in that group can be upgraded to level 4 (the highest possible). Otherwise, the number of upgrades a property can have corrpesponds to the number of properties in the group belonging to tha player.
* When a player stops by a property owned by another player, he/she has to pay complete rent of the property plus 50% of the rent of any other property in the same group.

## Hospital
* The hospital is similar to the jail, in that if a player is hospitalized, he/she has to stay for a certian number of rounds before being freed.
* Once in the hospital, the player becomes immobilized for 4 rounds instead of 3.
* The player can attempt to get a dice roll to get out of the hospital early. The player gets out of the hospital if the dice roll is smaller than or equal to 5.
* The player can also get out of the hospital early by paying a $100 fee.

## Bank
* The bank is where players can deposit their money in order to earn interest.
* A player cannot use his/her savings to purchase or upgrade property. However, if he/she does not have enough cash to pay for other deductions, the savings can be used.
* A player can place transactions whenever he/she wishes, but those transactions will only be processed when they pass either bank.
* At the time a transaction is processed, if the player does not have enough cash/savings, the transaction will be cancelled.
* The interest rate is 5 %. Interest is paid at the beginning of each of the player's turns.
